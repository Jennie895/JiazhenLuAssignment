Arrays and Strings

1.
String is immutable, so if we don't want alter the string value, then go with string.
StringBuilder can append and change every character in string, if we have such request, then choose StringBuilder.

2.
System.Array

3.
Use Array.Sort();

4.
Total number of elements is array.Length()+1

5.
Only the data of the same datatype can be stored in a single array.

6.
System.Array.CopyTo() is used to copy the value to an existing array, while System.Array.Clone will create a new array 
of the same type with the same value. 
Both modifying the original array won't change the new array.
But if the element in the array is an object, since both copy and clone are shallow copy, any modifying on the object will 
affect the array as well.
